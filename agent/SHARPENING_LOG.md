# SHARPENING_LOG.md — Periodic workflow improvements (timeboxed)

This log exists so we improve our way of working **without** turning process work into the work.

## Cadence

- Do a sharpening pass **once per 5 tags** (or once per 2 weeks, whichever comes later).
- Timebox: **10–15 minutes**.
- Outcome: pick **one** improvement only (script, skill, checklist tweak, or habit).

## Template (copy/paste)

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — <short title>

Friction observed:
- <what was repetitive / wide / noisy>

Decision (1 improvement only):
- <what we’ll change>

Change:
- <file/script>

Verification:
- <commands>

Follow-up (optional):
- <one next idea, not executed>
```
